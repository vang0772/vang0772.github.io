  I love to travel. I love learning about new places and people, discovering different cultures. And of course, eating. Travel allows me to do all that and more.

  My first experience out of the country was Quebec City in Quebec, CANADA. Though it may not seem very far from Minnesota, it was a great international expereince. It is one of my favorite places I have visited, and I hope to go visit it again one day.

  <p>
    Ever since I was a young kid, I always loved to read. I loved going to the library and checking out as many books as I wanted--for free!
  </p>
  <p>
    One of my favorite books is "The Giver" by Lois Lowry. I also love the Harry Potter and Hunger Game series.
