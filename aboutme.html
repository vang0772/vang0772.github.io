   I love quotes. They help me process and give me perspective.
</p>

<p>
   Being a Hmong woman and mother to two young daughters, this is a quote I try to keep in mind.
   This quote helps me focus on what's really important when I'm feeling stressed or overwhelmed.

   <h3>Who am I?</h3>
</p>

<p>
My name is Nou Vang, and I'm a proud first-generation Hmong college graduate. I am proud of my Hmong heritage and try to pass it along to my two young dauthers, ages 5 and 2. Since graduating college, I have always worked in education helping student prepare for their future.
</p>

<p>
Currently, I live in Minneapolis, MN with my husband and two daughters. We enjoy spending time as a family exploring the Twin Cities and being outdoors.
